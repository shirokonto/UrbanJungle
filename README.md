# Wilma On Edge
A third-person 3d platformer made in Unity using C# for a course project at HTW Berlin, Germany. :video_game:

After a long night of partying, the chaotic Wilma wakes up in her room and remembers that
she have to meet her date in half an hour at Pizza Plaza but oh my, the door won't open. She's been locked up and her roommates are all out.
Her only way seems to be through the window over the city's rooftops. Maybe she finds something to dress to make a better impression on the date.
Your goal is to get to the date as quickly as possible within the time limit and pick up as many items as possible. 

The pre-release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/shirokonto/UrbanJungle/releases)(Latest version: Version 1.0.0).

## Idea :bulb:
Wilma On Edge (working title: Urban Jungle) was inspired by Mirror's Edge and Infamous, where the player parkours over the roofs of 'The City' and Seattle. In our brainstorming session we planned the features, which we could achieve together in five weeks.
